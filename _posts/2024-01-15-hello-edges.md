title: "Hello from the edges"

I’ve always been drawn to the places where disciplines overlap. In the past year I’ve been moving between editorial work, field
recording sessions, and experiments in digital health.

This blog is a small space to keep notes on what I’m learning: the tactile parts of publishing, the quiet focus of radio, and the
ways technology can support more human rhythms. Thanks for stopping by.
